The original/old plastic housing fan is getting dirty and noisy due to dust. So I'm eager to throw it away and replace it with a true 
fanless housing. During the search, I found a metal pi 3 case from Taobao China. It is a perfect solution for me.

There are two version available: one for 3B and one for 3B+ due to the different chip location. I have both version.

Pros:
1. fanless
2. clean
3. silent
4. big heatsink

Cons:
1. Block wireless/BT signal
2. More expensive than plastic case
3. Passive Heat dissipation

As suggested by other people having the same case, I filed the metal columns with fine sand paper to remove the paint. Then I applied 
sufficient thermal paste between the contact points and screwed both upper and lower case together. That's it.

To go overboard in getting better heat dissipation, I ordered two heatsink and attach to the housing with wire. And it manages to lower 
the temperature by around 1 degree. Obviously it is completely waste of money and time. Nevertheless, I ordered two more set for my two
other Pi 3B and 3B+.
