# Fanless Pi 3 metal housing
My first Pi plastic housing fan has been getting dirty and noisy due to dust. So I was eager to throw it away and replace it with a true 
fanless housing. During the search, I learnt there is metal case for Pi 3 and I managed to find one on Taobao.com. It is a perfect solution for me.

There are two variants available: one for 3B and one for 3B+ due to the different chip location. I end up having both variants..

## Pros and Cons
Pros:
1. fanless
2. clean
3. silent
4. big heatsink

Cons:
1. Block wireless/BT signal
2. More expensive than plastic case
3. Passive Heat dissipation

As suggested by other people having the same case, I filed the metal columns with fine sand paper to remove the paint. Then I applied 
sufficient thermal paste between the contact points and screwed both upper and lower case together. That's it.

To go overboard in getting better heat dissipation, I ordered two heatsinks and tie them to the housing with wire (remember to remove
the four rubber stubs below the case). I reckon I might get better result by sanding off the paint from the contact surface but I didn't bother to do it. 

The addition of heatsinks manages to lower the temperature by around 1 degree. Obviously this is completely waste of money and time. And I ordered two more set for my other 3B and 3B+ anyway. ^_^;
