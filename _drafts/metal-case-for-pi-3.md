# Fanless Pi 3B/B+ metal housing
My first Pi plastic housing fan has been getting dirty and noisy due to dust. So I was eager to throw it away and replace it with a true 
fanless housing. During the search, I learnt there is metal case for Pi 3B and I managed to find one on taobao.com. It is a perfect solution for me.

There are two variants available: one for 3B and one for 3B+ due to the different chip location. I end up having both variants..

## Pros and Cons
| |Pros|Cons|
|-|:---|:---|
|1| Fanless | Block wireless/BT signal |
|2| Clean | More expensive than plastic case |
|3| Silent | Passive heat dissipation results in CPU warmer then using fan |
|4| Dissipate heat via metal body | |

As suggested by others people having the same case, I filed the metal columns with fine sand paper to remove the paint. Then I applied 
sufficient thermal paste between the contact points and screwed both upper and lower case together. That's it.

## Adding heatsinks
In order to get better heat dissipation, I decided to go overboard a bit and ordered two heatsinks from taobaon.com and tie them to the housing with wire (remember to remove the four rubber stubs below the case). I reckon I might get better result by sanding off the paint from the contact surface but I didn't bother to do it. 

The additional heatsinks managed to lower the temperature by around 1 degree C. 

Obviously this is completely waste of money and time. And I ordered two more sets for my other 3B and 3B+ anyway. ^_^;
