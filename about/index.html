	<h1>This site</h1>
	<p>I will use this site to record my home automation setup. It will serve as my built log so I can refer to it later for any enhancement.<br>
	If you are looking for reference project on your own home automation project, I do hope my materials can be helpful toonl you.<br>
	Currently my setup only consists of a Raspberry Pi 3B running Home Assistant Hass.io with Mosquitto MQTT server. A Sonoff Basic on Tasmota controlling a water heater.</p><br>
  	<h1>Me</h1>
  	<p>Always like to automate stuff. From equipment automation to FF characters auto level, I just don't see the point of doing routine tasks manually.</p>
