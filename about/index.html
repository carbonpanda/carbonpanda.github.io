	<h1>This site</h1>
	<p>This site is for me to record my home automation setup. It will serve as my build log so I can refer to it for any enhancement later. There is always room for improvement.<br><br>
	If you are looking for reference projects for your own home automation development, I hope you will find my materials helpful.<br><br>
	Currently my setup only consists of a Raspberry Pi 3B running Home Assistant Hass.io with Mosquitto MQTT server. A Sonoff Basic on Tasmota firmware controlling a water heater and it is interfaced to Siri and Google Assistant.</p>
  	
	<h1>Me</h1>
  	<p>Always like to automate stuff - from equipment automation to FF characters Exp, I just don't see the point of doing routine tasks manually.</p>
